## 🧱 Architecture

The app follows a layered **clean architecture** with **MVI pattern**:

presentation/

CitiesViewModel
CitiesViewState / Event / SideEffect
UI Composables
domain/

City (domain model)
UseCases (LoadCities, SearchCities)
data/

CityDto
CityRepositoryImpl
CityLocalDataSource (preloaded & indexed in memory)


- **State-driven UI**: using `ViewState`, `ViewEvent`, and `SideEffect` contracts.
- **DI with Hilt**: for injecting use cases, repositories, and data sources.
